## Rough draft

Hi Sang,

Thank you for offering me the position of Full-stack Developer in your company.

As I had mentioned during our meeting on 02/09/2017 (Thursday), I am an international student and
I need to obtain work authorization from USCIS in order to work off-campus. I will be applying for this at the earliest possible and
as per my university's website, the process may take between 1 and 3 weeks.

# Taking this into account, I cannot start working from the date mentioned in the offer letter.

For this reason, I'd be really grateful if it was possible for you to wait
